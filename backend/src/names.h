/* Triton expects certain definitions within its backend libraries to follow
 * specific naming conventions. Specifically, for a backend named
 * "tools_identity," most definitions should appear within a namespace called
 * triton::backend::tools_identity.
 *
 * In order to facilitate this with minimal effort on the part of backend
 * developers, we ask that you put the name of your backend here. This macro is
 * then used to propagate the correct namespace name wherever it is needed in
 * the impl and interface code. */
